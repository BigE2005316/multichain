Trailing stop loss automatically adjusts your stop loss as the price increases, locking in profits while protecting against downturns.

**Example:**
â€¢ Buy at $100, set 15% trailing stop
â€¢ Price rises to $140 â†’ Stop loss moves to $119 (15% below peak)
â€¢ If price drops to $119, position is closed with profit

Enter your trailing stop percentage (e.g., 15 for 15%):`);
